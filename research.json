    "Lead_with_Interest_Not_Credentials": "Show you’ve actually read their work — mention one project/paper/course you liked and why it caught your attention.",
    "Drop_Credentials_Casually": "Slip in your experience naturally (e.g., 'In high school, I started a data engineering company…') instead of making a brag list.",
